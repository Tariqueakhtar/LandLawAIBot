Chapter IV \\nRent Indexes 42 \\nTenancy GuideRent Indexes \\nAbout Property Rent Index \\nThe Property Rent Index in the Emirate of Dubai was created pursuant to Law \\nNo. (1) of 2009. RERA creates, revises and updates this Index periodically. \\nThis Index is used as guidance to determine the rent values of properties of \\nvarious uses in all regions of the Emirate of Dubai. This Index serves as a reference in the event of a dispute between landlords and tenants in determining the rates of increase in rental values. There is coordination between RERA and the Judicial Commission for Settlement of Disputes between Landlords and Tenants to implement the provisions of the Law in this regard. \\nContents of the Index \\nFor the purpose of creating the Index, all types of properties and rental units \\nin the various regions of the Emirate of Dubai were listed. An electronic data record was created for each area. The record includes types of units and their uses, the minimum and maximum rent values, and the average rent payment. The Index is divided into three main areas by region, namely: Deira, Dubai, and freehold areas. Property uses are determent as follows: residential, commercial and industrial. \\nRent calculators have been also created for commercial complexes and malls, \\naccording to their respective classifcations. Indexes for certain projects in freehold areas have been created. \\nRent Increase Calculator \\nThis calculator serves as a guide for calculating rates of increase in rents and \\nidentifying the rent values in the various areas. The benefciary logs into the offcial website of Dubai Real Estate Community, and selects the rent calculator link. The required data are then entered to easily inquire about the increase rate and the average rent for the area and the unit. 43 \\nRent IndexesRent Increase Calculator Service \\nLogin Form: \\nVisiting the website: \\nwww.dubailand.gov.ae \\nE-services \\nRent Increase Calculator \\nNote: The rent increase calculator is updated on regular basis. 44 \\nTenancy Guide Demonstration of Calculating the Increase in Property Rent \\nPursuant to Decree No. 43 of 2013 Determining the Increase in \\nProperty Rent in Dubai \\nRelation Between Average Rent \\nAnd The Prescribed Rent Increase Rate \\nPrescribed Rent \\nIncrease Rate Current rent stated in the applicant’s \\ncontract compared to the \\naverage comparable rent \\n00 % 00 % - 10 % No increase in the rent of the real estate \\nunit, if the rent is less than or equivalent to 10% of the average comparable rent. \\n05 % 11 % - 20 % 5% of the rent of the real estate unit, if the rent is less by 11% up to 20% of the average comparable rent. \\n10 % 21 % - 30 % 10% of the rent of the real estate unit, if the rent is less by 21% up to 30% of the average comparable rent. \\n15 % 31 % - 40 % 15% of the rent of the real estate unit, if the rent is less by 31% up to 40% of the average comparable rent. \\n20 % 41 % and more 20% of the rent of the real estate unit, if the rent is less by more than 40% of the average comparable rent. \\nExample of calculating the increase in property rent rate in the Emirate of Dubai according to the fees: Average rent in the offcial index = AED 80,000 \\nCurrent rate stated in the lease contract = AED 60,000 Calculating the decrease in rent below the average rent in the offcial index \\n80,000 - 60,000 x 100 80,000 \\nDecrease in rent below the average rent in the offcial index – 25% Upon referral to the cases stated in the Decree, the rate in this case will be from 21-30%, which allows an increase of 10% Increase in rent= 60,000 x 10% = AED 6,000 Rent after increase: 60,000 + 6000 = AED 66,000 ',\n",
