There is coordination between RERA and the Judicial Commission for Settlement of Disputes between Landlords and Tenants to implement the provisions of the Law in this regard. \\nContents of the Index \\nFor the purpose of creating the Index, all types of properties and rental units \\nin the various regions of the Emirate of Dubai were listed. An electronic data record was created for each area. The record includes types of units and their uses, the minimum and maximum rent values, and the average rent payment. The Index is divided into three main areas by region, namely: Deira, Dubai, and freehold areas. Property uses are determent as follows: residential, commercial and industrial. \\nRent calculators have been also created for commercial complexes and malls, \\naccording to their respective classifcations. Indexes for certain projects in freehold areas have been created. \\nRent Increase Calculator \\nThis calculator serves as a guide for calculating rates of increase in rents and \\nidentifying the rent values in the various areas. The benefciary logs into the offcial website of Dubai Real Estate Community, and selects the rent calculator link.
