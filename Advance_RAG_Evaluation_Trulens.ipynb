      "To find the best tenancy option in Dubai, it is recommended to utilize the EJARI online program developed by RERA. This program is designed for recording tenancy contracts for all types of property in the Emirate of Dubai, ensuring compliance with regulations and providing a structured process for real estate lease and management. By using EJARI, tenants can benefit from upgraded real estate services, registration, and regulation, ultimately helping in selecting the most suitable tenancy option in Dubai.\n"
